## 🧩 Overview

The system is built around four specialized AI agents:

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| 🔍 **Stock Finder** | Identifies promising NSE-listed stocks based on recent performance, news buzz, volume, or technical strength |
| 📊 **Market Data Analyst** | Gathers technical data including price, volume, trends, RSI, and moving averages |
| 📰 **News Analyst** | Analyzes recent news articles and classifies sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral |
| 💰 **Price Recommender** | Provides actionable Buy/Sell/Hold recommendations with target prices |

A **Supervisor agent** orchestrates the workflow between these agents using LangGraph.
